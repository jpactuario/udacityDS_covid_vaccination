# COVID-19 Vaccine Inequity and Hesitancy

## Motivation

As of today, the race against COVID-19 is going well in many countries as life has returned to something that resembles normalcy in many rich countries. However, when we look at many developing countries, the picture cannot be more different. And in some rich countries where vaccine access cannot be easier, the vaccination rate stalls at a low level, leading them to experience the “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.

Using the dataset from Our World In Data, we will explore what factors explain the vaccination inequity and hesitancy and what we can be done to alleviate these problems. The dataset has also been enhanced with the childhood vaccination rate indicators from the World Bank which we hope could capture the attitude towards vaccination in general.

## Questions

Questions to be explored are:

1. Does richer country has higher vaccination rate?

   The answer is an obvious yes.

2. What factors best explain the difference in vaccination rate in addition to the economy?

   The most important factors that explain the vaccination rate in the descending order are:

   - GDP per capita
   - Life expectancy
   - Childhood vaccination rate (using Polio as a proxy)

3. How can we quantify or visualise Vaccine Hesitancy and which countries have the worst Vaccine Hesitancy problem?

   By looking at the number of days required to vaccinate an increment percentage of its population, we can observe the following trends:

   - Southern Europeans are least hesitant at getting vaccinated.
   - This is followed by Western Europeans with some notable exceptions such as the Dutch, Swiss, and German.
   - English-speaking countries (UK/Canada/Ireland) started off very strongly until reaching the 65% mark but are now facing a significant challenge to encourage the remainder of the adult population to get vaccinated.
   - Despite being the first country to start the mass-vaccination program, the United States faced a significant headwind and has fallen much behind the other countries.
   - Lastly, Central and Eastern Europeans are the most resistant in getting vaccinated.

Further explanation on the answers to these questions can be found in the iPython Jupyter notebook `COVID-19 Vaccine Inequity and Hesitancy.ipynb` and also on [my blog post](https://jpactuario.medium.com/covid-19-vaccine-inequity-and-hesitancy-427a36034117).
